# Erogonomic development on the Yale&nbsp;SOM&nbsp;HPC

Ahoy friends ðŸ‘‹ &mdash; These are the notes from my
2024-05-28 presentation about making your development
experience on the Yale SOM HPC more ergonomic.

I broke our time together into three parts:

1. [Connecting to the HPC](/connecting-to-the-hpc)
2. Running Jupyter notebooks and RStudio remotely on the HPC
3. Editing code remotely with VSCode
4. Using tmux to manage your terminal sessions
