# Erogonomic development on the Yale&nbsp;SOM&nbsp;HPC

Ahoy friends ðŸ‘‹ &mdash; These are the notes from my
2024-05-28 presentation about making your development
experience on the Yale SOM HPC more ergonomic.

I broke our time together into four parts:

1. [Connecting to the HPC](/connecting-to-the-hpc)
3. [Editing code remotely with VSCode](/remote-dev-with-vscode)
4. [Using tmux to manage your terminal sessions](/tmux)
2. [Running Jupyter notebooks and RStudio remotely on the HPC](/running-notebooks)
